Generics:
> A generic class increases the reusability. The more type parameters mean more reusable it becomes. However, too much generalization makes code difficult to understand and maintain.

> A generic class can be a base class to other generic or non-generic classes or abstract classes.

> A generic class can be derived from other generic or non-generic interfaces, classes, or abstract classes.
